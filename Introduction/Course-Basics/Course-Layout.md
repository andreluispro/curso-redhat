# Course Layout

## Course Navigation

- This course is organized into chapters and sections, which are listed in the course outline.

## Section Content

- Sections start with an overview video, are followed by supporting text, and end with an assessment. The chapters are meant to be done in order, but you can skip ahead if you have already mastered the material in a particular chapter. You will need to go to the course outline to navigate to other chapters.

## Quizzes

- Some sections contain multiple choice quizzes which are not graded but are intended to test your knowledge.

## Guided Exercises and Labs

- Chapters can contain both guided exercises and labs. The difference between a guided exercise and a lab is that a guided exercise lists all information needed to complete the task, while labs give you an opportunity to test your knowledge.

- Labs will ask you to perform a set of tasks and it's up to you to determine how to accomplish each of them based on what you've learned so far. Lab solutions are available by clicking the Show Solution button. All labs and guided exercises have a discussion board where you can post questions. See <Setting Up the Lab Environment> for instructions on setting up a lab environment.

- Guided exercises and labs are not graded, but it is highly recommended that you complete them on your own in order to get the most out of this course.

## Comprehensive Review

- This course contains a comprehensive review at the end with questions that cover all chapters.
