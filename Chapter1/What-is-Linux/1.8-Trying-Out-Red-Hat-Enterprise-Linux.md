# Trying Out Red Hat Enterprise Linux

There are a number of different ways to try Red Hat Enterprise Linux. One is to download an evaluation copy from the Red Hat website. A number of links to supplementary information are also available on that page.

Red Hat also makes available free subscriptions of a number of our products for development purposes through the Red Hat Developer Program. These subscriptions allow developers to easily develop, prototype, test, and demonstrate their software on the same enterprise products that it will eventually be deployed with.

Another approach is to deploy an instance of Red Hat Enterprise Linux made available through a cloud provider. For example, in this course the hands-on labs are designed to use an official Red Hat Enterprise Linux image provided through a major cloud provider's image catalog.
